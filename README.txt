These logos were drawn in Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format [2] for RAC by
Tyler Tidman VA3DGN.  Wherever possible, the Portable Network Graphics (PNG)
format [3] is now being used for all auto-generated bitmaps.  The chosen
fonts, "DejaVu Sans Bold", "DejaVu Sans", "DejaVu Sans Bold Condensed" and
"DejaVu Sans Condensed" [4] are provided gratis under a free license.

Inspiration for these logos was provided by the SVG version of the ARRL ARES
logo posted on Wikipedia [1] and the old RAC logos donated by James Ewen
VE6SRV.

Software that was used to create and work with these files:
  - GNU Make (3.81) [5]
  - Inkscape (0.46, 0.47) [6]
  - Imagemagick (6.3.7, 6.6.0-4) [7]
  - Debian Linux "Squeeze/Stable" (6.0.3, 6.0.4) [8]

Type "make" to magically generate all bitmap versions from the source .svg
files.
