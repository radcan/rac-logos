These logos were drawn in Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format [2] for RAC by
Tyler Tidman VA3DGN.  Wherever possible, the Portable Network Graphics (PNG)
format [3] is now being used for all auto-generated bitmaps.  The chosen
fonts, "DejaVu Sans Bold", "DejaVu Sans", "DejaVu Sans Bold Condensed" and
"DejaVu Sans Condensed" [4] are provided gratis under a free license.

French translations were provided by Tyler Tidman VA3DGN and verified by Serge
Langois VE2AWR and Claude Lalande VE2LCF.  Inspiration for these logos was
provided by the old RAC logos donated by James Ewen VE6SRV.

Software that was used to create and work with these files:
  - GNU Make (3.81) [5]
  - Inkscape (0.46, 0.47, 0.48) [6]
  - Imagemagick (6.3.7, 6.6.0-4) [7]
  - Debian Linux (6.0, 7.0) [8]

Type "make" to magically generate bitmap versions from the source vector .svg
files.
